      Chinese Gooseberry Cheesecake, every dish is a delight."<p>

      <h2>Great Food & Friendly Service</h2>
    </header>
    <p>"Long established restaurant that moved across the street to a new location several years ago due to road construction. We go there at
      least once a week for lunch or dinner. I usually get the daily special (pork is especially good on Thursday and chicken pot pie on Sunday).
      Breakfast is what draws the people and it can get very crowded early, but I am not a morning person. At noon on Sat and Sun, be prepared
      to wait. Many of the servers have been here for years and are very friendly...<a href="glossary.html" target="_blank">just last weekend
      I wrote an entire GLOSSARY while I was having lunch there!</a>."<p>
